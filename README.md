Base skeleton to create REST API using Golang

**DISCLAIMER**

```
This repo only provide base skeleton to create a REST API using
Golang, to save your time from building REST API from scratch.
You can modify all of processes based on your needs!
```

---

## Dependencies 

- gorilla/mux       : For routing
- gorilla/handlers  : For http middleware
- alexsasharegan/dotenv : For env variables

---

## Command Line Usages

```
go run --race *.go
```

Optional parameters:
- `-debug` : Enable debug mode
- `-enablePrintStack` : Enable to print stacktraces when panic happened
- `-address` : Set your ip and port
- `-timeout` : Set your write & read
- `-env` : A path to your env file

Examples:

```
go run --race *.go -address=127.0.0.1:7000
```

## Routes 

All of your api controllers should be placed at `handler/`, then you need to
register your controller in `routes.go`, example:

```go
routes = append(routes, Route{"GET", "/hello", controller.HelloWorld})
```

And that's it.  For now, i'm not think about sub router or others, but you can 
modify this route's process based on your needs.

If you area clone this repo into your own project's folder, you need to change
`routes.go` at line `4` :

```go
controller "base-golang-api/handler"
```

Example:

```go
controller "myproject/handler"
```

---

## Middlewares

Default middlewares:

- Access logger : To log any of request and response access to your api
- Content negotiator : To filter and spesify http header content types
- Recovery : To prevent your api from crash if any panic happened

You can create your own middleware, just make sure that your function signature 
follow gorilla's middleware function:

```go
type MiddlewareFunc func(http.Handler) http.Handler
```
